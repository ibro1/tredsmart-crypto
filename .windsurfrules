## Project Rules
// Rule 1: Explicitly state each rule
1. At the end of every completed step, please record your work in @docs/PROGRESS.md Write down the implemented features, encountered errors and how we were able to fix all of those. Always answer these three questions, donâ€™t skip anything and be as concise and comprehensive as possible. 
3. Break down large file edits into smaller, focused changes.
4. When editing files, target only the specific sections that need to be changed.
5. Avoid making multiple edits to the same file in rapid succession.
6. Use `view_file` first to confirm the current state before making edits.
7. When creating a page with an action function or a form, always include a loading state on the submit buttons.
8. Before editing a page, first analyze and check the page.
9. Always remember this is a Remix app.
